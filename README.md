TukioHapa is a simple MERN-stack event management application that allows users to view upcoming events, create new events, buy tickets, and manage event details. The backend is built using Express.js, MongoDB Atlas, and Mongoose, providing a RESTful API for creating, updating, deleting, and listing events. The frontend is developed with React and Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive user interface. The project connects to a cloud-hosted MongoDB database, enabling real-time data updates and cross-device access. The backend is deployed on Render, while the frontend can be deployed on Netlify for seamless public access. Users can browse events, search for events, and confirm bookings through a simple and intuitive interface. Environment variables are used to secure database credentials, and the app supports full CRUD operations with ticket-booking logic included. This project demonstrates backend–frontend integration, API consumption, cloud deployment, and modern UI development in a real-world MERN application.
